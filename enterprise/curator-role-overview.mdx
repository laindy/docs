title: Curator Role Overview
description: Learn how to delegate group-level administration using the Curator role in Hymalaia Enterprise Edition.
---

The **Curator** role is available in Hymalaia Enterprise Edition.  
It enables group-level administration for large organizations by delegating data management to trusted users within specific groups.

Curators are essentially **group-level admins**.

---

## Curator Role Capabilities

Curators can manage resources that are specific to the groups they curate. Their capabilities include:

### ✅ Add and Remove Users

- Add and remove **Basic** users from their curated group(s).

### ✅ Create and Manage Credentials

- Create credentials for connectors that belong to the group(s) they curate.

### ✅ Create and Manage Connectors

- Set up connectors that belong **exclusively** to the group(s) they manage.

### ✅ Create and Manage Document Sets

- Build document sets tied to their group(s).
- Add connectors they curate to those document sets.
- Add/remove **public** connectors from document sets they curate.

### ✅ Create and Manage Personas

- Set up and maintain personas that belong exclusively to the group(s) they curate.

## Curator Role Restrictions

Curators do not have unrestricted admin access. Their role is scoped to their curated groups and comes with the following limitations:

### ❌ Cannot Edit Cross-Group Objects

- If an object belongs to another group that a Curator doesn’t curate, they **cannot edit it**.
- They **can still view** the object.
- They **can add/remove** it from document sets they curate or remove it from the group they curate.

### ❌ Cannot Create Public Objects

- Curators cannot create public objects (connectors, credentials, document sets).
- They **can** add or remove public objects from curated sets or groups.

### ❌ Must Attach Objects to a Group

- Curators **must** attach any object they create to a group they curate.
- Unattached objects are not visible or manageable to them, so this is disallowed.

## Global Curators

**Global Curators** are identical to regular Curators, except:

- They are **automatically** considered Curators for **all groups** they are members of.
