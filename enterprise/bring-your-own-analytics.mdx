title: Bring Your Own Analytics
description: Integrate your preferred analytics provider with Hymalaia using a simple configuration process.
---

As part of the Enterprise Edition, you can integrate your own analytics provider into Hymalaia. This enables features like:

- Session replays  
- Usage metrics  
- Behavior tracking  

You can use tools you're already familiar with (e.g., PostHog, Amplitude, Mixpanel, etc.).

---

## Setup Instructions

To enable custom analytics:

### 1. Set Environment Variable

Set the `CUSTOM_ANALYTICS_SECRET_KEY` to a secure, random string:

```bash
export CUSTOM_ANALYTICS_SECRET_KEY=2uIfMPVgHCTD57HU
```

> 💡 Save this key temporarily — you’ll need it in step 4.

### 2. Re-deploy Hymalaia

Apply the new environment variable by re-deploying your Hymalaia instance.

### 3. Open the Admin Panel

Navigate to the **Custom Analytics** tab in the admin interface.

### 4. Add Your Analytics Snippet

Paste your analytics provider’s JavaScript snippet into the provided field.

- This snippet is typically added inside `<head>` tags in a traditional web app.
- **Important**: The `<script>` tags **must be removed** before pasting into Hymalaia.
- Use the same `CUSTOM_ANALYTICS_SECRET_KEY` you set in step 1 when prompted.

## Example

Here’s an example of a script snippet you might receive from [PostHog](https://posthog.com/docs/libraries/js):

> **❌ Don't paste this:**

```html
<script>
  !function(t,e){...}</script>
```

> **✅ Paste only this:**

```js
!function(t,e){...}
```
