description: Understand how document access permissions are managed in Hymalaia based on connector access levels.
---

In Hymalaia, permissions for what documents users can and cannot access are determined by the **access level** set for each connector.

---

## Connector Access Types

There are three types of connector access:

### 1. Public

- Any user in your Hymalaia instance can access the documents in the connector.

---

### 2. Private

- Documents from **private connectors** are only accessible to users in the **group(s)** that the connector is attached to.
- You can assign connectors to one or more groups in the admin panel.

---

### 3. Sync

- **Sync connectors** inherit permissions from the **source platform**.
- For example, if a Google Drive document is only shared with a specific user, only that user will be able to access it in Hymalaia.
- Matching is performed based on the user’s **email address**.
- **Document permissions for sync connectors are not editable within Hymalaia**.

#### Currently Supported Sync Sources:

- Google Drive
- Confluence
- Jira
- Slack

> ⚠️ Syncing ensures that Hymalaia respects your existing permission structure in connected platforms.
