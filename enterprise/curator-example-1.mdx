## Curator Example 1
### Scenario

You are a Curator for the marketing team and a basic member of the sales team.

You want to add a connector from the sales team’s group to a document set that belongs to the marketing team’s group.

---

### How to do it

First, the connector needs to be added to the marketing team’s group.

There are multiple ways to accomplish this:

1. You can have an admin promote you to **Curator** for the sales team’s group.
2. You can have an admin **add the connector** to the group.
3. You can **create a copy** of the connector yourself.

Once the connector is added to the group, you can add it to the document set.

---

### Important Note

Giving connector access to multiple groups (options **1** and **2**) will prevent the connector from being editable by Curators that don't curate *all* the groups the connector is a part of.

In this example, Curator 2 would lose edit control of the **Shared Sales Materials Connector**.

If this is not what you want, you can create a **new identical connector** for the marketing team’s group and add it to the document set.
