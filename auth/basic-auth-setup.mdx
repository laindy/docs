## Basic Auth Setup

This guide explains how to set up Hymalaia with basic username/password authentication. While this is the easiest way to get started, we **recommend using Google OAuth, OIDC, or SAML** for production environments.

If you’re unsure which auth approach fits best for your organization, feel free to [reach out to us](mailto:support@hymalaia.app) — we’re happy to help.

## 🛠️ Environment Variables

To enable basic authentication, set the following in your `.env` file:

```
AUTH_TYPE=basic
```

Once you've updated your environment and restarted Hymalaia, you should see a **Sign Up** screen when you visit the app.

> ✅ If you don’t want to require email verification, that’s all you need to do!

## 📧 Email Verification (Optional)

To require users to verify their email before accessing Hymalaia, add these additional values to your `.env`:

```
AUTH_TYPE=basic
REQUIRE_EMAIL_VERIFICATION=true

SMTP_USER=noreply@hymalaia.app
SMTP_PASS=<PASSWORD_FOR_THE_EMAIL_ABOVE>

# Only needed if not using a Google-powered email account
SMTP_SERVER=<YOUR_SMTP_SERVER>
SMTP_PORT=587
```

Once configured, Hymalaia will send a verification email with a **"link to verify"** to each new user. They won’t be able to use Hymalaia until their email is verified.

> If you're using a Gmail-powered account, you’ll need to enable access for less secure apps or configure an [App Password](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833).
