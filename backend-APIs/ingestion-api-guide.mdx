title: Ingestion API
description: Ingest arbitrary documents directly into Hymalaia using the backend API
---

The Ingestion API allows you to directly send arbitrary documents to Hymalaia's backend for indexing and search. This is useful for cases where data doesn't originate from an existing connector or when you want to supplement/override specific content.

---

## üìö Typical Uses

Use the Ingestion API when:

- You have documents not tied to any connector but useful for search.
- You want to **programmatically ingest documents** instead of setting up a connector.
- You want to **edit existing docs** without altering their original source.
- You want to **enhance connector docs** (e.g., attach a README to a GitHub project).

---

## üöÄ Example: Ingesting a Web Document

This example sends a document of type `"web"` to Hymalaia via `curl`.

```bash
curl --location 'localhost:8080/hymalaia-api/ingestion' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_API_TOKEN>' \
--data '{
  "document": {
    "id": "ingestion_document_1",
    "sections": [
      {
        "text": "This is the contents of the document that will be processed and saved into the vector+keyword document index. ",
        "link": "https://docs.hymalaia.app/introduction#what-is-hymalaia"
      },
      {
        "text": "You can include multiple content sections each with their own link or combine them. ",
        "link": "https://docs.hymalaia.app/introduction#main-features"
      }
    ],
    "source": "web",
    "semantic_identifier": "Hymalaia Ingestion Example",
    "metadata": {
        "tag": "informational",
        "topics": ["hymalaia", "api"]
    },
    "doc_updated_at": "2024-04-25T08:20:00Z"
  },
  "cc_pair_id": 1
}'
```

## üîç Field Breakdown

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `id` | Unique document ID. If omitted, it's generated from `semantic_identifier`. Existing docs with same ID are updated. |
| `sections` | List of content sections. Each has `text` and optionally a `link`. Sections are used for chunking and influence search results. |
| `source` | Source type (e.g. `"web"`). Full list found under `DocumentSource` in Hymalaia code. |
| `semantic_identifier` | Acts as the **title** of the document in the UI. |
| `metadata` | Metadata such as `tag` or `topics`. These are displayed as document **tags**. Accepts string or array. |
| `doc_updated_at` | Timestamp of last update. Hymalaia uses this to apply recency-based scoring. |
| `cc_pair_id` | Connector ID the doc should belong to. Use `1` for default. This links the doc to connector groups and deletion. |

## üì• Checking Ingested Documents

You can view all documents that have been indexed through the ingestion API using the corresponding endpoint (e.g. `/hymalaia-api/ingestion-docs`).
