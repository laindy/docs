## Understanding Google Cloud Storage Structure

Google Cloud Storage organizes your data into **buckets**.  
Each bucket can contain an unlimited number of **objects (files)**.

You can think of a **bucket** as a root folder and the **objects** as its files.

For more details, see the [Google Cloud Storage documentation](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/introduction).
