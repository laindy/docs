title: Salesforce Connector
description: Access knowledge from your Salesforce Objects
---

### How it works

- Indexes documents from your Salesforce instance  
- Organized around the **Salesforce Objects** you indicate (e.g., `Account`, `Opportunity`)
- Includes data from related child objects (e.g., Contacts, Notes)

---

### Setting up

#### Authorization

1. Log into your **Salesforce** account
2. Make sure the user is either:
   - An **organization member**, or
   - Has **admin access** to the data you want to index

3. Click your **profile avatar**, then choose **Settings**
4. Go to **My Personal Information â†’ Reset My Security Token**
5. Check your email for your **new Security Token**
6. You will use:
   - Your **Salesforce Username**
   - Your **Password**
   - The **Security Token**

---

### Indexing

1. Navigate to the **Admin Dashboard**
2. Select the **Salesforce Connector** tile
3. Provide the following:
   - **Username**
   - **Password**
   - **Security Token**
4. Indicate the **Salesforce Object(s)** you want to index

> ðŸ“Œ Use the **singular** version of the object name (e.g., `Opportunity`, not `Opportunities`)  
> ðŸ“Œ If no objects are specified, the connector will **default to `Account`**

---

### An Example

If you choose to organize by `Account`, Hymalaia will:

- Create one document per **Account**
- Attach to each document all related data:
  - Including children objects like **Contacts**, **Notes**, etc.
- For Contacts that are not attached to any Account, you must **explicitly include `Contact`** in the object list

---

This allows you to tailor how your Salesforce data is indexed and organized within Hymalaia.
