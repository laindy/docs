description: Capture discussions from Zulip Streams and Topics

## How it works

- The **Zulip Connector** pulls in all **streams** and **topics** based on the permissions assigned to the Zulip bot user.
  
---

## Setting up

### Authorization

Hymalaia interfaces with Zulip using a Zulip Bot, which is authenticated via the `zuliprc` config format. For more context directly from Zulip, refer to the following docs:

- [Running Bots](https://zulip.com/api/running-bots)
- [Configuring Python Bindings](https://zulip.com/api/configuring-python-bindings)

### Steps to Create a Zulip Bot:

1. **Create a Zulip Bot**.
2. Copy the **Bot authentication info** (the contents of the `zuliprc` file). 

   Example of the authentication info:
   ![ZulipRC Example](image_path)

3. Keep the copied `zuliprc` information for the next step.

## Indexing

1. Navigate to the **Admin Dashboard** and select the **Zulip Connector**.
2. In Step 1, paste the copied `zuliprc` value.
3. Grab your **Zulip Realm/URL** information (shown below):

   Example:
   ![ZulipRealmURL Example](image_path)

4. In Step 2, provide the **Realm** and **URL** values.

Once configured, the Zulip Connector will start indexing discussions from Zulip Streams and Topics.
