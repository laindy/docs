## How it works

The **Gmail Connector** ingests your emails and syncs the latest information from Gmail every **10 minutes**.  
> 📩 Currently supports **plain text emails only**.

## Setting up

> ⚠️ This connector is relatively involved to set up.

There are two options to configure the Gmail Connector:

### Option 1: OAuth Setup for Individual Accounts

If you're setting up for a **personal Gmail account**, follow the guide [here](#) (OAuth-based).  
✅ This method **does not require** a business Google Workspace account.
