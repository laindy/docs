## How it works

The GitHub Connector indexes **Pull Requests** and **Issues** from your specified repositories.

It will:
- Index **both Open and Closed PRs**, including the **Title** and **Summary**
- Index **both Open and Closed Issues**, along with their **comments**
- Include metadata such as:
  - **URL**
  - **Creator**
  - And more

## Setting up

### Authorization

This connector uses a **GitHub Access Token**.

Follow these steps:

1. Log in to [GitHub](https://github.com).
2. In the upper-right corner, click your **profile avatar** and select **Settings**.
3. Scroll down to **Developer settings** → **Personal access tokens** → **Tokens (classic)**.
4. Click **Generate new token**.
5. **Grant `repo` access** so the token can access PRs and Issues.
6. Set an **expiration time**.
   > ⚠️ Once the token expires, you must generate a new one and update it in Hymalaia to keep indexing up-to-date.

### Indexing

1. Go to the **Admin Dashboard**.
2. Select **Add Connector** and click on the **GitHub** tile.
3. Provide:
   - The **GitHub Access Token**
   - The repository URL (e.g., `https://github.com/hymalaia-dot-app/hymalaia`)
   - An optional name for your credentials
4. Click **Create Connector**.

Hymalaia will automatically begin indexing your GitHub repository.
