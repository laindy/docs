## How it works

- The **Zendesk Connector** syncs all the **published Articles** in your company’s Zendesk subdomain.
  
### Limitations:
- It does not pick up **Zendesk Tickets**.
- It does not include **comments**.
- It pulls all the articles without the ability to select by **Category**.

1. **Subdomain** of the Zendesk tenant (e.g., `your-company.zendesk.com`).
2. **Email address** of the user to impersonate (owner of the **API Token**).
3. **API Token**.

### Getting the API Token:

1. Log into Zendesk.
2. Navigate to **Admin > Channels > API**.
3. Under the **Tokens** tab, create a new API token and copy it.

### Indexing

1. Navigate to the **Admin Dashboard** and select **Add Connector** followed by the **Zendesk** tile.
2. Provide the required information:
