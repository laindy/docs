## How it works  
The Confluence connector pulls in all pages and comments from the specified spaces/pages once at the beginning and then pulls updates every 10 minutes.

## Setting up  

### Authorization  
Follow the guide described [here](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/basic-auth-for-rest-apis/) to get an access token.

### Indexing  
1. Navigate to the **Admin Dashboard** and select the **Confluence Connector**.

2. For your credentials, provide the following:
   - **Access Token**
   - **Username** (typically an email address)

3. For Confluence setup, provide:
   - **Wiki Base URL**: The base URL of your Confluence instance (e.g., `https://your-domain.atlassian.net/wiki`)
   - **Is Cloud**: Check this box if using **Confluence Cloud**, uncheck if using **Confluence Server/Data Center**

4. Then choose how youâ€™d like this connector to index your Confluence instance:

#### Everything
- Indexes all content the provided credentials have access to.

#### Space
- Input the **key** of the space to index (e.g., `KB`).

#### Page
- **Page ID**: ID of the specific page to index (e.g., `131368`).  
  Leave empty to index the entire space.
- **Index Recursively**: Check to index the specified page **and** all of its children.

#### CQL Query
- If you want finer control over what is indexed, use a **CQL query**.
- Your query must contain `type=page`.  
  Note: Any `lastmodified` filters will be overwritten.

5. Click the **Connect** button!  
   All the specified spaces/pages and their comments will now be pulled into Hymalaia every 10 minutes.

## Permission Syncing  
If you are an **enterprise customer** connecting to **Confluence Server/Data Center** and you want to enable **permission syncing**, the provided credentials must belong to an **admin user**.
