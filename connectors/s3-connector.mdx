### Step 1: Provide AWS credentials

You can provide:

- **AWS Access Key ID**
- **AWS Secret Access Key**
- Optionally, a **Profile Name** (used if no access key is set)

If none are provided, the connector will try using the default AWS credentials on the environment.

- Click **Connect** to begin indexing

> ✅ You can add more buckets using the same credentials

## Understanding S3 Structure

Amazon S3 organizes data into **buckets**, each containing unlimited **objects** (files).  
Think of a bucket as a root directory and each object as a file within it.
