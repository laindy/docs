## How it works  
The ClickUp connector will pull in all tasks from the ClickUp workspace, or specific space(s), list(s), folder(s) specified by the user.

Tasks are updated every 10 minutes.

## Understanding ClickUp Hierarchy  
In ClickUp, there are multiple containers which contain task(s). These could be:

- Entire Workspace  
- Spaces  
- Folders  
- Lists  

Detailed information on the hierarchy of the above-mentioned objects is available here:

3. Select the type of connector you want to pull tasks from.  
   **Notes**:  
   - This could be **Entire Workspace**, **Space(s)**, **Folder(s)**, or **List(s)**.  
   - To pull tasks from the entire workspace, just select **Entire Workspace** from the dropdown and do not add any ID(s).  
   - To pull tasks from specific **Space(s)**, **Folder(s)**, or **List(s)**, select the respective option from the dropdown and add the ID(s) below. At least one ID needs to be added in this case.  
   - The space ID(s), folder ID(s), and list ID(s) can be found in the web URL in ClickUp.  
     For example, if you open a list in ClickUp, you will see the list ID in the address bar:

4. If any of the **Space(s)**, **List(s)**, or **Folder(s)** connector types is selected, add one or more respective IDs to index the tasks from.

5. Check **Retrieve Task Comments?** if you also want to retrieve and index all comments for each indexed task. Leave this unchecked if you donâ€™t want to index task comments.

6. Click **Connect** to begin indexing.
