description: Access knowledge from your Notion workspace

## How it works
The Notion connector uses the Notion search API to fetch all pages that the connector has access to within a workspace. For follow up indexing runs, the connector only retrieves pages that have been updated since the last indexing attempt. Indexing is configured to run every 10 minutes, so page updates should appear within 10 minutes.

## Setting up

### Authorization

In order to authorize Hymalaia to connect to your Notion workspace, you’ll need to create a new integration in Notion, which will then provide you with a secret token.

These steps are pulled from this Notion guide which you can also follow.

#### Step 1: Create an integration

1. Visit [Notion Integrations](https://www.notion.com/my-integrations).
2. Click the **+ New integration** button.
3. Name the integration (e.g., "Hymalaia").
4. Select **Read content** as the only capability required.
5. Click **Submit** to create the integration.
6. On the next page, copy your integration token (API key).

Note: Any member can share pages and databases with the integration. Admin rights are not required.

#### Step 2: Share pages/databases with your integration

1. Go to the page or database in your workspace.
2. Click the `•••` on the top right.
3. Scroll and click **Add connections**.
4. Select the newly created integration.

> If a page is added, all child pages become accessible. For databases, all rows and children become accessible.

## Indexing

1. Go to the **Admin Dashboard** and select the **Notion connector**.
2. In Step 1, provide the **Integration Token Secret**.
3. Click **Connect**.

Your content will then be pulled into Hymalaia every 10 minutes.

> Note: If you want to limit specific content, unshare the database or page from the integration in Notion.
