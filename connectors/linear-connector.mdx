## How it works

The Linear connector pulls in:

- All **issues**
- All **associated comments**

> Data is refreshed every **10 minutes**.

---

## Setup

### (Self-Hosted Only) Configure your Linear Application

> ⚠️ **Skip this section** if you're using **Hymalaia Cloud**.

- Create a **Linear Application** from your [Linear Developer settings](https://linear.app/settings/developers).
- You must be an **admin** of the Linear workspace.

**Set callback URL** to:
```
<your-hymalaia-host>/connector/oauth/callback/linear
```

For example:
```
http://localhost:3000/connector/oauth/callback/linear
```

**Set environment variables** using the Client ID and Signing Secret from Linear:

```env
LINEAR_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
LINEAR_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
```

Then **restart** your Hymalaia instance.
