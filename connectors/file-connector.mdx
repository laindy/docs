## How it works

The File Connector indexes user-uploaded files for retrieval and AI-powered answers.

- Supports: `.txt`, `.pdf`, `.docx`, `.pptx`, `.xlsx`, `.csv`, `.md`, `.mdx`, `.conf`, `.log`, `.json`, `.tsv`, `.xml`, `.yml`, `.yaml`, `.eml`, `.epub`
- You can also upload a `.zip` containing the supported file types
  - Unsupported file types inside the zip will be ignored
- Optionally, you can add a metadata line to enhance searchability

## Adding Metadata

Add a metadata line at the very **top** of your file. Supported formats:

```
#HYMALAIA_METADATA={"link": "<LINK>"}
<!-- HYMALAIA_METADATA={"link": "<LINK>"} -->
```

This line must contain valid JSON. Available keys:

- `link`
- `primary_owners`
- `secondary_owners`
- `doc_updated_at`
- `file_display_name`
- Any custom `key: value` pairs (used as searchable tags in the UI)

### Example

```txt
#HYMALAIA_METADATA={
  "link": "https://github.com/hymalaia-dot-app/hymalaia/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md",
  "primary_owners": ["yuhong@hymalaia.app", "chris@hymalaia.app"],
  "secondary_owners": ["founders@hymalaia.app"],
  "doc_updated_at": "2023-11-30T13:06:08.589616-08:00",
  "file_display_name": "Desired File Name!",
  "status": "draft"
}
```

### Full file example

```txt
#HYMALAIA_METADATA={"link": "https://www.hymalaia.com/captcha", "file_display_name": "Captcha Setup"}

### Zip Upload + Metadata

When uploading a `.zip`, you can include a `.hymalaia_metadata.json` at the root of the archive:

```
| file1.txt
| file2.txt
| .hymalaia_metadata.json
```

Example `.hymalaia_metadata.json`:

```json
[
  {
    "filename": "file1.txt",
    "link": "https://example.com/file1",
    "file_display_name": "File 1",
    "primary_owners": ["owner1@example.com"],
    "status": "in-review"
  },
  {
    "filename": "file2.txt",
    "link": "https://example.com/file2",
    "file_display_name": "File 2",
    "primary_owners": ["owner2@example.com"],
    "status": "approved"
  }
]
```

## Setting up

### Authorization

- No external authentication is required.

- Admins can upload files and make them available to everyone.
- *(WIP)* Users will soon be able to upload personal files and keep them private.

### Indexing

1. In the **Hymalaia Admin Dashboard**, go to the **File Connector**
2. Upload a supported file or a `.zip` archive
