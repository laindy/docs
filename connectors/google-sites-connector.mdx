## How it works

Export your Google Site using **Google Takeout**, and then upload the zip to Hymalaia.  
We’ll index all your pages, making the site content searchable and allowing you to ask questions about it!

## Setting up

### Exporting Your Google Site

- Follow the [Google Sites export guide](https://takeout.google.com/).
- Be sure to **include ONLY your Google Site** in the export folder.
- You’ll receive a `.zip` file containing your site content.

---

### Indexing the Export

1. Go to the **Admin Dashboard** in Hymalaia.
2. Select the **Google Sites Connector**.
3. Enter the **base URL** of your Google Site (i.e., the root URL of your published site).
4. Upload the **.zip file** you downloaded in the export step.
5. Click the **Upload** button.

Once the upload is complete, Hymalaia will begin indexing your site.  
After indexing, the content will be searchable and available for question answering.
