## How it works

- The **Web Connector** scrapes sites based on the base URL.
- It only indexes files from the same domain and base path.
- The connector indexes pages that are reachable via hyperlinks starting from the base URL.
- The text contents are cleaned up using heuristics, and metadata (e.g., page Title) is extracted.
