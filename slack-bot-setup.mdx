## HymalaiaBot Introduction
Hymalaia will connect to your Slack and listen for messages to answer.

You can easily configure rules for what channels Hymalaia should respond in, what knowledge sets should back each configured channel, and set filters to respond or not respond to different types of messages.

When Hymalaia identifies valid questions, it will respond in the message thread with:

- An LLM generated answer
- Quotes of the most relevant excerpts
- Sources with highlighted keywords

Hymalaia also provides a configuration page so you can create custom settings for each slack channel (or you can just use the default settings for all your channels).

Since we are using Web Sockets, Hymalaia is able to initiate the connection. This means that this is able to work even if you are running Hymalaia inside a firewall protected VPC.
