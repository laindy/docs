title: "[Recommended] EC2 Setup"
description: Setup Hymalaia on AWS EC2
---

Using EC2 (or an EC2 equivalent like GCP, Azure, or DigitalOcean) is the **recommended** way to deploy Hymalaia. It‚Äôs simple and should meet the performance needs of 90% of organizations.

While this guide is written for AWS EC2, most of the steps apply to other cloud providers as well.

## Getting an Instance

Start by launching an EC2 instance with the following recommended specs:

- **RAM**: At least 16GB  
- **vCPU**: 4-8 cores  
- **Disk**: 500GB

> ‚úÖ For reference, our Cloud offering uses `m7g.xlarge` with 500GB of EBS storage.

When configuring your **security group**, ensure **HTTPS traffic** is allowed.

---

## Pointing your Domain

Next, point your **domain** to your new EC2 instance:

1. Grab your **public IP address** from the AWS Console.
2. Go to your **DNS provider** (e.g., GoDaddy).
3. Add **two DNS A records**:

   - `@` ‚Üí points to your EC2 public IP
   - `www` ‚Üí also points to the same IP

If you don‚Äôt have a domain yet, you can skip HTTPS and continue with plain HTTP for now.

## Installing Dependencies

Install required dependencies: `git`, `docker`, and `docker-compose`.

```bash
sudo yum update -y

sudo yum install docker -y
sudo service docker start

sudo curl -L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/latest/download/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m) -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

sudo yum install git -y
```

---

## Starting up Hymalaia

1. Clone the Hymalaia repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hymalaia-dot-app/hymalaia.git
```

2. Set environment variables:

```bash
cd hymalaia/deployment/docker_compose
touch .env
touch .env.nginx
```

3. In `.env`, paste the following (edit fields as needed):

```bash
WEB_DOMAIN=<YOUR_DOMAIN>  # e.g. "hymalaia.app"
VALID_EMAIL_DOMAINS=<YOUR_COMPANY_DOMAIN>

AUTH_TYPE=basic
# To enable email verification:
# REQUIRE_EMAIL_VERIFICATION=true
# SMTP_USER=<YOUR_EMAIL>
# SMTP_PASS=<EMAIL_PASSWORD>

# For Google OAuth, comment the above and uncomment:
# AUTH_TYPE=google_oauth
# GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=
# GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=
# SECRET=<GENERATED_UUID>

GEN_AI_MODEL_PROVIDER=openai
GEN_AI_MODEL_VERSION=gpt-4

POSTGRES_USER=postgres
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password
```

4. In `.env.nginx`, add:

```bash
DOMAIN=<YOUR_DOMAIN>  # e.g. "hymalaia.app"
```

---

## SSL with Let's Encrypt

Run the following to generate your SSL certificate:

```bash
./init-letsencrypt.sh
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è If skipping HTTPS, use the command below to start the app:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml -p hymalaia-stack up -d --build --force-recreate
```

Then access Hymalaia via your instance‚Äôs **Public IPv4 DNS** or **IP address**.

---

## You're All Set! üéâ

After a few minutes, Hymalaia should be ready. To confirm:

```bash
docker logs hymalaia-stack-api_server-1 -f
```

Wait for:

```
INFO: Application startup complete.
```

And you're good to go!
