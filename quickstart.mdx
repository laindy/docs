## Requirements

- Git
- Docker with compose (docker version >= 1.13.0)

## Setup

The most common source of issues is under-resourcing. Before beginning, check the system requirements here.

<Note>
This is just one way to run Hymalaia. Hymalaia can also be run on Kubernetes, there are provided Kubernetes manifests and Helm charts in the deployment directory.
</Note>

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the Hymalaia repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hymalaia/Hymalaia.git
```

### Step 2: Navigate to Docker Compose Directory

```bash
cd hymalaia/deployment/docker_compose
```

### Step 3: Configure and Deploy

1. (Optional) configure Hymalaia

2. Bring up your docker engine and run:

To pull images from DockerHub and run Hymalaia:
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml -p hymalaia-stack up -d --pull always --force-recreate
```

Alternatively, to build the containers from source and start Hymalaia, run:
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml -p hymalaia-stack up -d --build --force-recreate
```

<Note>
- This may take 15+ minutes depending on your internet speed.
- Additionally, once the images have been pulled / built, the initial startup of the `api_server` may take some time. If you see "This site can't be reached" in your browser despite all containers being up and running, check the `api_server` logs and make sure you see "Application startup complete".
- If you see "Killed" in the logs, you may need to increase the amount of memory given to Docker. For recommendations, check the system requirements here.
- These commands are also used to redeploy if any **.env** variables are updated
</Note>

Once completed, Hymalaia will be running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Generative AI API Key

<Note>
On the initial visit, Hymalaia will prompt for a GenAI API key.
</Note>

For example, you can get an OpenAI API key at: [https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)

Hymalaia relies on Generate AI models to provide parts of its functionality. You can choose any LLM provider from the admin panel or even self-host a local LLM for a truely airgapped deployment.

## Shutting Down

To stop Hymalaia, run:
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml -p hymalaia-stack down
```

<Tip>
Add `-v` at the end to additionally delete the volumes (containing users, indexed documents, etc.)
