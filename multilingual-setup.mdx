title: Multilingual Setup
description: Configure Hymalaia to support languages other than English.
---

Hymalaia can be configured to support multiple languages beyond English. This guide walks you through how it works and how to set it up.

## How it works

Hymalaia relies on two core components that assume English by default:

1. **Vector Search and Reranking**  
   These components use embedding models to retrieve relevant documents for the LLM.

2. **LLM Prompts**  
   These are used to guide the LLM in how to respond.

To support multilingual scenarios:

- Swap out English-first embedding/reranking models for **multilingual models**.
- Apply **query expansion** to rephrase the user query into target languages.
- Provide **LLM instructions** to respond in the same language as the user query.

> ⚠️ **Note**  
> The built-in LLM prompts are still in English. For fully non-English use, consider translating all prompts directly into your target language.

## Configuration

Hymalaia supports multilingual setup entirely through environment variables. For Docker Compose, create a `.env` file inside the `hymalaia/deployment/docker_compose` folder.

Here's an example configuration for **English** and **French**:

```env
# Rephrase user query in multiple languages
MULTILINGUAL_QUERY_EXPANSION="English, French"

# Use a multilingual embedding model
DOCUMENT_ENCODER_MODEL="intfloat/multilingual-e5-small"

# Prefixes used by the embedding model
ASYM_QUERY_PREFIX="query: "
ASYM_PASSAGE_PREFIX="passage: "

# Normalize embeddings (model dependent)
NORMALIZE_EMBEDDINGS="True"

# Disable LLM chunk filtering for better multilingual support
DISABLE_LLM_CHUNK_FILTER="True"

# Disable reranking (English-first models are not optimal for multilingual use)
ENABLE_RERANKING_ASYNC_FLOW="False"
ENABLE_RERANKING_REAL_TIME_FLOW="False"

# Enable fine-grained mini-chunking for better recall
ENABLE_MINI_CHUNK="True"

# Use a stronger model for better multilingual understanding
GEN_AI_MODEL_VERSION="gpt-4"
```

> 📝 An up-to-date template for multilingual settings is also available in the codebase under hymalaia/deployment/docker_compose.

## Recommendations
- For full translation, localize all prompt templates in your target language.

- Use multilingual embedding models from trusted sources (e.g. Hugging Face).

- Prefer LLMs with multilingual support (e.g. GPT-4, Claude, etc.).
