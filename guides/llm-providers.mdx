## Custom Providers

Hymalaia supports custom LLMs via the [LiteLLM](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers) provider list. You can integrate specialized or internal models to align with your organization's privacy, cost, or domain-specific needs.

## Choosing the Right Model

| Factor            | Recommendation                                                      |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Task Complexity** | Use GPT-4 or Claude-3 Opus for heavy reasoning or complex requests   |
| **Speed**           | Use GPT-3.5-Turbo or Claude-3 Haiku for fast, lightweight queries    |
| **Cost**            | Consider cheaper models for high-volume use cases                   |
| **Privacy**         | Self-host models like Llama 2 if data privacy is critical           |
| **Specialization**  | Evaluate model strengths for tasks like coding, writing, or support |

> ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** For most use cases, **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** is recommended due to its optimal balance of power and performance.

## Leveraging Model Flexibility

- **Experiment:** Compare models on real queries to assess response quality.
- **Monitor:** Use Hymalaia analytics to understand which models perform best.
