## Choosing the Right Model

| Factor               | Recommendation                                                                 |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Task Complexity**   | Use larger models like `text-embedding-3-large` or `voyage-large-2-instruct`   |
| **Language Specificity** | Cohereâ€™s models are ideal for English-specific applications                   |
| **Performance vs. Efficiency** | Consider `-light` models for faster processing with some trade-offs        |
| **Setup Complexity** | OpenAI and Cohere are simpler to set up; Gecko requires GCP configuration       |

## Best Practices

- **Experiment:** Try different models with your real data to compare results.
- **Monitor:** Track effectiveness across different use cases.
- **Update Regularly:** Check for updates or new model versions from providers.
