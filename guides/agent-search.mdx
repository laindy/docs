Agent Search is Hymalaia advanced knowledge retrieval system that enables answering complex, multi-faceted questions by intelligently decomposing queries, searching across multiple contexts, and synthesizing comprehensive answers.

Unlike traditional search, Agent Search approaches questions like a knowledgeable colleague would:  
1. **Decompose and disambiguate**  
2. **Analyze narrow, well-defined sub-questions**  
3. **Synthesize and present comprehensive context-rich answers**

> 💡 *Example:* When comparing two products (e.g. Car A vs. Car B), Agent Search will independently explore both, then compare them to form a rich, contextual answer.

## Key Features

- **Intelligent Query Decomposition**  
  Breaks complex questions into precise sub-questions

- **Parallel Search Processing**  
  Executes multiple analysis threads simultaneously

- **Answer Validation**  
  Refines and validates responses for accuracy and completeness

## Configuration

### Basic Setup

To enable Agent Search in your Hymalaia deployment:

1. Update to the latest version of Hymalaia
2. Configure knowledge source connections
3. Set up LLM provider credentials
4. Enable the **Agent** toggle in the chat interface (with a search-capable assistant)

### Advanced Configuration

#### Best Practices & Suggestions

- Don’t hesitate to ask **complex or multi-layered questions**.
- Try **comparative queries** like:
  > _“What’s the difference between Solution A and B?”_  
  Agent Search will separately analyze A and B before comparing.
- Ask **ambiguous questions** such as:
  > _“What are the guiding principles for X?”_  
  The system will use context to clarify what "guiding principles" refers to.
- Even **simple questions** may benefit from deeper, contextualized answers.
- **Click on sub-question analyses** — they may provide interesting insights individually.

> ⚠️ It is recommended to assign a **faster/cheaper LLM model** as your *Fast Model*, since Agent Search performs many parallel queries.

## Common Issues and Solutions

| Issue                          | Solution                                                                                      |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Langgraph/Langchain errors** | Ensure server uses Python 3.11 and installs libraries from `backend/requirements.txt`.        |
| **Rate limits**                | Agent Search may hit rate limits due to parallel queries. Use a provider with higher limits.  |
| **Timeouts**                   | Timeout thresholds are enforced to avoid blocking. Contact support if these are too strict.   |
| **High token usage**           | Expect significantly more input/output tokens than with Basic Search.                        |

---

## Summary

Agent Search offers a powerful way to surface deeper insights, especially when working with ambiguous or multi-faceted questions. For best performance:

- Use optimized LLM configurations
- Expect and account for higher token usage
- Experiment with your queries to see how well the system synthesizes knowledge
